# Predict Housing Price
In this modern era, estimating housing prices accurately is challenging due to market volatility and factors like area and location. An automated AI system is proposed to predict housing prices efficiently by analyzing market trends and other relevant factors, helping buyers make informed investments without brokers. The goal is to estimate selling prices, analyze price ranges, and predict future prices for developments. Design Thinking, a solution-based approach involving five stages—Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test—will be used to tackle this complex problem. The AI and ML-powered system will organize data conveniently to predict housing prices accurately, ensuring secure and fruitful investments for customers by considering factors such as location, population, and house characteristics.
